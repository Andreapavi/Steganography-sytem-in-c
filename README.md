# ppm-steganography-in-c
1st Coursework for F28HS, 2nd year of Bsc Computer Science. 

For the 1st coursework of Hardware-Software interface we have been given instruction to create a program 
that would be used for encoding a message into an image in .ppm format, and retrieve it. This is my version of it.

Instructions, design choices, data structures used and algorithms used can be found in steg_report.pdf                
The program source has been encrypted in steg.zip due to the coursework being still used in the module.

If you wish to take a look at the code, please request the password at pavanandrea97@icloud.com
